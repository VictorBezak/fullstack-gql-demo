# fullstack-gql-demo

This is intended to be a template for a fresh full-stack app.

The tech-stack featured in this template is:

- package-manager: yarn
- API spec: GraphQL
- Database: undetermined
- Frontend-Framework: undetermined

## Plans

- Keep this template agnostic to the choice of DB and frontend-framework, but build the template out further so that it is easier for someone to plug-in their tools-of-choice
- Once we have a base template complete, perhaps we can explore a setup-script that will prompt you for your option of package-manager, api-spec, db, and front-end framework
- We also need to decide if we want to provide any boiler-plate in our template to support an HTTP-client, or if we just want to create empty files to designate a place for the user to craft their own implementation
